<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Computer Science graduate after my college graduation I was just interested in making web pages and I was doing little projects basically simple webpages to my friends and relatives after that I grew to stage where I can even make money through it. </p>
<p> While doing this I was also in the process of pursuing my life time dream "BECOMING AN IPS OFFICER"</p>
<p>I was aspiring UPSC Civil Services examination but unfortunately after years my financial and physcial condtions got worse thankfully I had my another passion of coding </p>
<p>I am a type of person who have a mindset to give 100 percent in what we have rather than wasting time on worrying about what we dont have, I will be a great developer, I will keep learning.</p>
